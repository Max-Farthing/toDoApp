# toDoApp
## This is a simple fullstack toDo application where you can write down tasks and steps to complete said tasks

### I used this project as a learning experience as it is my first attempt creating a fullstack app

### This App was created using:
###  ***React*** for the Frontend
###  ***Express*** to create a ***REST API*** for the backend
###  ***MongoDB*** database
